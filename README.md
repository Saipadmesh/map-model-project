# map-model-project
A project made using flask that simulates traffic junctions and roads in a smaller scale using a graphDB called Neo4j.

The model also uses Djikstra's algorithm to determine shortest route between two junctions.
The project uses Bokeh and Bootstrap to display the output in a webpage.
